Welcome to my home on the Internet!

My name is Arvind and I am an aspiring Computer Science student in the United States. You can expect to find posts written about tech as that is what I most passionate about. I may occasionally write about something random, from interesting history to life advice I've found helpful.

If you'd like to share your thoughts, hit me up on Twitter [@SkinnyBonesArv](https://twitter.com/SkinnyBonesArv). If it's something longer, shoot me an email (<contact@arvind.dev>).
