### Hey,

My name is Arvind. I’m a student, programmer, and opinionated citizen. Welcome to my home on the internet.

On this website, you can expect to find articles about tech, since that is what I am most passionate about. Occasionally, you can find other content ranging from interesting history to life advice I’ve found helpful.

If you’d like to share your thoughts, hit me up on Twitter ([@Arvonit](https://www.twitter.com/Arvonit)). If it’s something longer, shoot me an email ([me@arvind.dev](mailto:me@arvind.dev)).
